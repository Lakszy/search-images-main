Default - By default, show the images from
https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getRecent.html
(NOTE - add safe_search value in query params (read reference) to avoid restricted images)



Search - A search bar should be placed in the header. When a user is typing, display results
from https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html



Infinite Scroll - As you scroll down to the bottom of the page, display more results if there
are more results.



4. Suggestions - Save their search queries (in the browser itself) so that the next time they
come back, you can suggest search queries (like as a list/tags near the search bar).



5. Preview - Clicking on a photo in the results will bring the photo up in a modal.



***BONUS***

●Make the search as efficient as possible with edge cases(0 results, More than x results )


● Showing proper loaders and placeholders


● The search bar section should be fixed on top of the page results as you scroll down on the
page
